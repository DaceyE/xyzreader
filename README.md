## Summary
**E**xample of applying material design to an app severely lacking any design.  This is a before and after project of updating an app UI.  XYZreader is built around a dummy API that consists of a single JSON file and images.


## Specifications
**Common Requirements**  
•  Follow Java style guide, git style guide, [core app quality guide][1], and [tablet app quality guide][2].   

**Required Behavior**  
•  App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).  
•  App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.  
•  App theme extends from AppCompat.  
•  App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.  
•  App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).  
•  App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.  
•  App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.  
•  App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.  
•  App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.  
•  App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.  
•  List items' background colors are dynamically calculated base on the image.  
•  A staggered grid is used for the list.  
•  Detail screen pages on a horizontal swip.  
•  Swip-to-refresh is implemented for the top of the list.  


## Issues
•  Supporting backend is no longer up.  If I work on this more I'll self host the JSON file and images.   
•  Repo should be merged with the other demo applications for convenience.  
•  Upload Java style guide used.  
•  Upload Git style guide used.  
•  The above guides should be written as an html doc styled like the Android developer docs.  
•  Before images would make so much sense.  


## Images
**S**creenshots are from a API 22 emulator and a 7th generation kindle fire.  At the moment there are no before pictures.
