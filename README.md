# XYZreader ![alt text][launcher]


## Summary
Example of applying material design to an app severely lacking any design.  This is a before and after project of updating an app UI.  XYZreader is built around a dummy RSS feed.


## Specifications
**Common Requirements**  
•  Follow Java style guide, git style guide, [core app quality guide][1], and [tablet app quality guide][2].   

**Required Behavior**  
•  App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).  
•  App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.  
•  App theme extends from AppCompat.  
•  App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.  
•  App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).  
•  App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.  
•  App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.  
•  App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.  
•  App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.  
•  App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.  


## Issues
•  Demo videos, images, and links to download app are forthcoming.   
•  API may or may not still be functional.   
•  Repo should be merged with the other demo applications for convenience.  
•  Upload Java style guide used.  
•  Upload Git style guide used.
